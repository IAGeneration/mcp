# swagger-mcp

## Overview
`swagger-mcp` is a tool designed to scrape Swagger UI by extracting the `swagger.json` file and dynamically generating well-defined mcp tools at runtime. These tools can be utilized by the MCP client for further tool selection.

## Prerequisites
To use `swagger-mcp`, ensure you have the following dependencies:
1. **LLM Model API Key / Local LLM**: Requires access to OpenAI, Claude, or Ollama models.
2. **Any MCP Client**: (Used [mark3labs - mcphost](https://github.com/mark3labs/mcphost))

## Installation and Setup
Follow these steps to install and run `swagger-mcp`:

```sh
go install github.com/danishjsheikh/swagger-mcp@latest
swagger-mcp
```

## MCP Configuration
To integrate with `mcphost`, include the following configuration in `.mcp.json`:
```json
{
    "mcpServers":
    {
        "swagger_loader": {
            "command": "mcp-swagger",
            "args": ["<swagger/doc.json_url>"]
        }
    }
}
```

## Demo Flow

## üõ†Ô∏è Need Help  
I am working on **improving tool definitions** to enhance:  
‚úÖ **Better error handling** for more accurate responses  
‚úÖ **LLM behavior control** to ensure it relies **only on API responses** and does not use its own memory  
‚úÖ **Preventing hallucinations** and **random data generation** by enforcing strict data retrieval from APIs  

If you have insights or suggestions on improving these aspects, please contribute by:  
- **Sharing your experience** with similar implementations  
- **Suggesting modifications** to tool definitions  
- **Providing feedback** on current limitations  

Your input will be invaluable in making this tool more reliable and effective! üöÄ
